On compiling file, peer.py, user will can see a prompt :- Do you want to send a message:(Y/N)?

If user enters N, then the server side of the peer will be turned on, and server's IP address and port number will be visible to clients.

If user enters Y, then the client side of the peer will be turned on, and the client has to enter server's IP address and port number in order for client to connect with the server, then the client will have to enter a password in order to connect to the server.

For this, we have set password to "project"
